In this repository, you will see a demo Angular application with localization. It locales in 5 languages: en, es, de, fr, pt. The text of the application is localized according to the language of your browser. Date formats are also localized, as well as formatting and parsing in the ng-bootstrap Datepicker. The days and months of the ng-bootstrap Datepicker are also localized.

You can download the code or also try it on StackBlitz.
